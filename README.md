I was the main contributor to this group paper and subsequently presented it in class, receiving the highest overall grade of 95%. 

The purpose was to describe Google's LaMDA system released in early 2021. That being said, it is in its infancy stages and is quite secretive.
As it was built upon its predecessor, Meena, this paper focuses more on Meena but connects the two.

In particular:
-What is an open-domain chatbot system? Why is this research important?
-How was Meena developed? How was it evaluated?
-How was performance compared to existing open-domain chatbot competitors?
-What are potential sources of bias? Are these critical?
-Why is the discovery of perplexity as an automatic evaluation system to "human likeness" critical for the industry?

I wrote this paper after dissecting existing Meena research papers and studying the existing open-domain chatbot industry.
